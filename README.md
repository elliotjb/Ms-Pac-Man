##Version 0.5

Game intro added.    
Level 1 added: Ms Pacman can move through all the level while eating every pill. She will die every time he collides with a ghost. There are 4 of them and they move randomly through the level. Eating special pills will give Ms Pacman the ability to eat them for a few seconds.    
Ms Pacman lives have been set to 3. If player loses all of them he will be sent to the "select players" screen.
